  **What is Expense Tracker ?**


An expense tracker is a tool or application that helps individuals or businesses track their expenses. It allows users to record their expenses and categorize them into different types, such as housing, food, transportation, entertainment, etc. By keeping track of their expenses, users can better understand where their money is going and make more informed decisions about their spending.

Expense trackers can be particularly useful for people who want to:

- Monitor their spending habits and identify areas where they can cut back
- Plan and manage their budgets
- Keep track of business expenses for tax purposes or reimbursement
- Analyze their spending patterns over time and make informed financial decisions

**Technology**

The  main technologies that  i used in Expense Tracker are  :
 1. React.js : i used nodejs to create the frontend because  ReactJS  makes it easier to break down the UI into small, reusable components. This helps to improve code organization and makes it easier to manage complex UIs.
 2. MongoDB:  I used MongoDB because MongoDB is a popular database system that is used for storing data.  MongoDB is open source and has a large community of developers and users, which means there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting. 
 3. Node.js :  I used Node.js because it allows developers to use JavaScript code to build back-end services, web applications, and APIs.

**Why we use ?**

We use an expense tracker for a variety of reasons, including:

1. Budgeting: Expense trackers can help us plan and stick to a budget by providing an overview of our spending habits, showing us how much we've spent in different categories, and identifying areas where we may be overspending.

2. Financial awareness: By tracking our expenses, we become more aware of our financial situation and can make better decisions about our money.

3. Saving money: By understanding our spending habits and identifying areas where we can cut back, we can save more money and work towards financial goals.

4. Accountability: Expense trackers can help us be more accountable for our spending by providing a record of our transactions and allowing us to track our progress over time.
